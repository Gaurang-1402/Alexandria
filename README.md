\begin{abstract}
Alexandria is a Virtual Reality (VR) application developed for the Oculus Quest 2, focusing on reinventing the experience of reading digital books in EPUB format. The project aims to create a unique reading environment that extends beyond the limitations of traditional digital platforms like PCs and mobile devices. Utilizing Unity, along with the VersOne.Epub library, HTML Agility Pack, Endless Book Unity plugin, and Simple File Browser Plugin, Alexandria addresses the technical challenges of EPUB parsing, realistic book rendering, and user-friendly navigation in a VR space. The application's design philosophy revolves around enhancing the reader's engagement with digital texts, providing an immersive library setting that combines the comfort of traditional reading with the interactivity and visual appeal of VR. Alexandria represents an exploration into how VR can transform and enrich the experience of engaging with literature.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The history of reading has continually evolved, from etching on stones to scrolls of papyrus, from bound paper to digital pixels.  In this tradition, I present Alexandria, a project designed to be a step forward in this progression, aiming to recreate the reading experience in virtual reality (VR).  The Oculus Quest 2, with its advanced features and wide adoption, serves as the perfect platform for this project.

Prior to Alexandria, reading books in VR was a compromised experience, typically achieved by accessing non-native applications like Kindle through a web browser. The result was often text that appeared less sharp and engaging than what VR technology could potentially offer. Moreover, the rich immersive potential of VR suggested that a native epub reader for this environment could significantly enhance the reader's engagement. This project was inspired by the challenge to replicate the deep, engrossing experience of reading long-form content in VR.

The core objective of Alexandria has been to create a reading experience where the application recedes into the background as the user becomes absorbed in the narrative. Just as one might lose awareness of the act of turning pages in a physical book, so too should the user of Alexandria forget they are interacting with a virtual interface, becoming completely engrossed in the story.

The foundation of this application is built upon the conviction that reading is inherently enjoyable, and it represents the initial steps toward a new evolution of readingâ€”one where narratives captivate not just visually but through multisensory engagement, including haptic feedback, sound, and immersive environments.

\section{Results and Demonstration}
\label{sec:results}
Alexandria successfully integrates an ancient virtual library environment where users can upload and read EPUB books. Key features demonstrated include the file upload interface, EPUB parsing, and realistic text rendering on a virtual book with book animations akin to a real-life book. The application's user interface, designed within Unity, offers intuitive navigation and interaction, making reading in VR as comfortable and engaging as reading in the real world.

The experience of reading the book is extremely important. A good reading experience is one where the reader is lost in the author's words and the book almost disappears as they are transported into the author's world. The whole point of the reading experience is to establish a connection between the author and reader and for the reading mechanism to disappear. A physical book achieves this and so do devices like Kindle. I am pleased to report that Alexandria achieves this immersive quality too, thanks to its familiar book interface, complete with detailed page flip animations and sounds.

From the user's perspective, the appflow is straightforward: they grant permission to access their Quest 2 files, upload a book, and then the book loads. The file upload interface is then hidden, allowing the user to start reading and move around the environment.

Under the hood, the book is stored in a persistent Data folder on Android. The EPUB book parsing and text rendering occur on a render texture.

This entire setup contributes to an accessible and easy-to-navigate user experience, even for beginners.

\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:design}

The project was structured into several key phases: \\
1) Development and Integration of a File Upload Interface: I utilized the Unity Simple File Browser Plugin, which is originally designed for Android devices, and adapted it for VR compatibility. \\
2) EPUB Parsing Mechanism: EPUB books use a specific HTML formatting. I extracted the raw HTML-formatted text from the EPUB books using the VersOne.Epub library. Then, I employed the HTML Agility Pack to isolate the book text from its surrounding HTML tags. TODO Double check \\
3) Camera Render Texture and Page Formatting: The text on each page dynamically changes with every page flip, both forward and backward. To achieve this, I created camera render textures for the left and right pages. During runtime, the text in these camera render texture pages is dynamically updated. Through trial and error, I determined the optimal number of words per page and adjusted the font size for clear legibility. \\
4) Book Control Logic: This was the most enjoyable part of the project for me. The key components of the book control logic include a charIndex array, which tracks the starting character on any given left or right page, and a pageIndex integer that increments or decrements with each page flip. For the book animations and materials, I utilized the Endless Book plugin available on Unity. \\ 
5) Integration of All Elements into a VR Library Environment: The final step involved integrating all these elements into a two-floor library environment, complete with bookshelves and a desk where the user's main book appears post-upload. I developed a locomotion system and a snap turn system, enabling users to walk around and carry the book with them if they wish. \\

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:evaluation}
Having received feedback from friends and family who tested Alexandria, it became apparent that the font and text size are crucial for an optimal reading experience. Therefore, a necessary improvement is to increase the book's text size.

Looking ahead, there are several enhancements I plan to implement. One key feature is cloud storage for users' uploaded books and their reading progress, enabling readers to seamlessly resume their reading from where they last stopped. Another addition I aim to introduce is a virtual shelf where users can store and access multiple books. A significant future development would be the inclusion of image rendering within the books, which might require the creation of an HTML and CSS renderer. This is a substantial task, explaining its absence in the current version. Furthermore, expanding the range of supported file formats and incorporating interactive features like note-taking could greatly enhance user experience.

A notable limitation of Alexandria at present is its exclusive compatibility with the Oculus Quest 2. In future versions, I plan to broaden the range of compatible devices to increase accessibility for a wider user base.
